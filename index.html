      <p>Based on nintendo previous management on updating in Spaltoon & Splatoon 2, Splatoon 3 usually will keep updating event and new stuff for around 2 years. The first release of Splatoon3 is 2022, which means 2024 is the last year for this game updating new stuff.
        However, the gamers have more negative reviews than positive ones. By comparing with previous splatoon, people find out that the design of UI is more flat, and the number of new gears is way less than previous work -- many gamers believe that Splatoon ip development will keep going down if nintendo keep fudging on updating useless stuff in this last year.
